# PregnancyCalculator

Every motherâ€™s journey through motherhood is unique and life-changing. Motherhood also brings a lot of difficulties. An app that can provide assistance to women during their pregnancy

This app has two main features: a due date calculator and weekly pregnancy updates. The PregnancyCalculator module is responsible for calculating the due date based on the first day of the last menstrual period, and the HealthInformation module provides weekly updates on the baby's development and any changes the mother may be experiencing.

The code sample I provided is written in JavaScript. It uses the JavaScript language to define a class called PregnancyAssistantApp that has two methods: getDueDate and getWeeklyUpdates.

The PregnancyAssistantApp class also has two properties: calculator and healthInfo. These properties are instances of other classes, PregnancyCalculator and HealthInformation, respectively. These classes are not defined in the code sample, but they would contain the functionality for calculating the due date and providing weekly pregnancy updates.
